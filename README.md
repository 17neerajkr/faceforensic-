overview to faster understanding :

The Deepfake Detector project focuses on identifying fake videos and images that are generated using AI, commonly known as deepfakes. These fake media files can be used to spread misinformation, harm someone's reputation, or even be used for scams. With the increasing use of such content, it's important to have a system that can detect whether a video or image is real or fake.

For this project, we used deep learning techniques, mainly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to build a model that can catch tiny details in a video—like strange facial movements, weird blinking patterns, or lighting issues that usually go unnoticed. The model was trained using a dataset that had both real and fake samples so it could learn the difference more accurately.

We also created a simple interface where users can upload a media file and get quick results. This makes it useful not just for tech experts but also for general users who want to check if something is real. Overall, this project gave us hands-on experience with AI and machine learning, and it also aims to help reduce the impact of fake digital content online.

# 🕵️‍♂️ Deepfake Detector

**Deepfake Detector** is an AI-powered application designed to identify manipulated media such as deepfake videos and images.  
With the rise of misinformation, scams, and privacy breaches caused by fake digital content, this tool helps users verify the authenticity of media using advanced deep learning techniques.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Deepfakes use AI to create convincing fake media — often indistinguishable to the human eye. Our project combats this by:

- 🧠 Leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect subtle anomalies  
- 👁️ Identifying irregularities such as **unusual blinking, odd facial movements**, or **inconsistent lighting**  
- 📁 Providing a **user-friendly interface** where users can upload images/videos for real-time analysis  
- 🛡️ Aiming to empower both experts and everyday users in the fight against digital misinformation

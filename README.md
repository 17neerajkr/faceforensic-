The Deepfake Detector project focuses on identifying fake videos and images that are generated using AI, commonly known as deepfakes. These fake media files can be used to spread misinformation, harm someone's reputation, or even be used for scams. With the increasing use of such content, it's important to have a system that can detect whether a video or image is real or fake.

For this project, we used deep learning techniques, mainly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to build a model that can catch tiny details in a video—like strange facial movements, weird blinking patterns, or lighting issues that usually go unnoticed. The model was trained using a dataset that had both real and fake samples so it could learn the difference more accurately.

We also created a simple interface where users can upload a media file and get quick results. This makes it useful not just for tech experts but also for general users who want to check if something is real. Overall, this project gave us hands-on experience with AI and machine learning, and it also aims to help reduce the impact of fake digital content online.
